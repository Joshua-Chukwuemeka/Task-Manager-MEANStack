# Task-Manager-MEANStack-App
This app is a MeanStack project built with MongoDB, Express, Angular and Node Js. This app is a task manager app that manages list of task. You can create a list and save tasks for each list you created. You can edit/delete a list and also edit/delete the tasks under it. Its has Login feature and also signup feature. So when using the app first sign up with email and password. So that's the functionality of the App.

I'll modify later and do unit testing and add other features to it.

# To run the App first navigate to the api/frontend folders and  do npm install on both the API and frontend project.
Then npm start to run the frontend app and node app.js to run the API code locally.

# This is a personal project to showcase my MEANSTACK Development Skills
